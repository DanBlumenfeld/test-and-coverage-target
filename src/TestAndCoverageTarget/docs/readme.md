# Test and Coverage Target

Adds a custom MSBuild target which will run tests and generate a coverage report locally.

Mostly just a convenience so that those who use test-driven coverage reports in their CI pipeline can check coverage locally before pushing

# How to use

See the [Github project README](https://github.com/DanBlumenfeld/test-and-coverage-target)
