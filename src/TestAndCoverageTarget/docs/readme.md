# Test and Coverage Target

Adds a custom MSBuild target which will run tests and generate a coverage report locally.

Mostly just a convenience so that those who use test-driven coverage reports in their CI pipeline can check coverage locally before pushing

# How to use

## TODO
Set up target, set up launch profile
